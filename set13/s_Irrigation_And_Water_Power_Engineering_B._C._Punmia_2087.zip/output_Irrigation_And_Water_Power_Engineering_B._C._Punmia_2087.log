thickness of apron in horizontal position=1.600000 m. 
 
 
 

provide thickness of 3.000000 m from d/s of weir wall to point 6 m from it. 
 
 
 

provide thickness of 2.400000 m from 6 m to 12 m from d/s end of weir wall.

check by Khosla theory: 

exit gradient=0.130000. < 1/6
 hence safe 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

pressure at d/s of weir wall=3.030000 m. 

thickness at d/s of weir wall=2.440000 m. < thickness by Bligh theory;
hence safe. 
 
 
 
 

pressure at 6 m from d/s of weir wall=2.646103 m. 

thickness at 6m from d/s of weir wall=2.130000 m. < thickness by Bligh theory;
hence safe. 
 
 
 
 

pressure at 12 m from d/s of weir wall=2.266357 m. 

thickness at 12m from d/s of weir wall=1.830000 m. > thickness by Bligh theory;
hence unsafe. 

hence increase th ethickness to 1.9 m for a length of 7 m of impervious floor.

upstream H.F.L=160.831000 m. 
 
 
 
 
 
 


uplift pressure on the roof=11.014979 kN/square m.
trough slab is 0.4 m thick and exert a downward load of 9.42 kN. 

th ebalance of the uplift pressure has to be resisted by bending action of trough slab.
so,reinforcement has to be provided at the top of the slab.

R.L of bottom of d/s cut-off=155.310000 m. 

length of d/s protection consisting of 40 cm brick pritching=7.000000 m.
pitching is supported by toe wall 0.4 m wide and 1.5 m deep at its d/s end.
length of d/s protection consisting of 0.4 cm brick pritching=5.000000 m.
pitching is supported by toe wall 0.4 m wide and 1 m deep at its u/s end.
