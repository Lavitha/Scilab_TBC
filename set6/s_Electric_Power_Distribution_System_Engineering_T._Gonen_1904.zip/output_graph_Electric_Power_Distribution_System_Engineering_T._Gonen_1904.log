Assuming a monthly load curve as shown in the figure attached to this code
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a) The annual power demand is 1141.55 kW
 
b) The annual load factor is 0.326158
 
The unsold energy, as shown in the figure is a measure of capacity and investment cost. Ideally it should be kept at a minimum

NOTE

 
The figure 1 attached along with this code is the Maximum diversified 30- min demand characteristics of various residential loads;
  A = Clothes dryer; D = range; E = lighting and miscellaneous appliances; J = refrigerator
 (Only the loads required for this problem have been mentioned)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 a) The 30 min maximum diversified demand on the distribution transformer = 18.456 kW
 
 b) The 30 min maximum diversified demand on the distribution transformer = 2064.6 kW
 
 c) The total hourly diversified demands at:
 
 i) 4.00 PM = 6.3276 kW
 
 ii) 5.00 PM = 9.6384 kW
 
 iii) 6.00 PM = 10.6356 kW
