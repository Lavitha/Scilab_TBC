 Refer to the figure 3.52   
 
 
 (a) Assuming the diode D to be ideal    
 
 
     Ignoring diode D,voltage across R2 is given as (By applying potential divider concept)   
 
 R1  =
 
    45.  
 
 R2  =
 
    5.  
 
 Vaa  =
 
    10.  
 
 Vab  =
 
    1.  
 

 Vab= 1 V 
 
 
 
  Thus,diode D is forward biased.It conducts,offering zero resistance  Hence no current would flow through the parallel bran 
      sh R2.The circuit equivalent to that shown in figure 3.53(a)                                                           
 
 ID  =
 
    0.2222222  
 

 Current through diode = 222 mA 

 
 
 
 (b)Assuming the diode to be real   
 
 
      Voltage Vab is much larger than Vt hencethe diode conducts.It is replaced by its equivalent as shown in figure 3.53(b) 
      .To determine current Id through the diode we first find the Thevenin's equivalent of the circuit on the left of AB.Vt 
      h=open circuit voltage across AB

 Vth=1 V 
 
 Rth  =

 Rth=4 ohm 
 
 
 Thus,the equivalent circuit becomes as shown in figure 3.53(c)

       Diodes D2 and D3 are reverse-biased. Therefore,  these are like open-switches. Diodes D1 and D2 are forward biased. T 
      hese are replaced by their equivalent circuits,as shown in figure 3.54. Since the diodes are silicon V=0.7V.

 (a) When the diode is forward biased figure 3.55(b),it offers zero resistance. It is like shorted switch.This shorted switc
