In accordance to figure 1.23a 
 
The Load current (current source) Il= 1A
 
The Load voltage (current source) Vl= 1V

 
 
 
 
 

In accordance to figure 1.23b 
 
The Load voltage (voltage source) Vl= 1V
 
The Load current (voltage source) Il= 1A

 
Therefore they both provide same voltage and current to load
