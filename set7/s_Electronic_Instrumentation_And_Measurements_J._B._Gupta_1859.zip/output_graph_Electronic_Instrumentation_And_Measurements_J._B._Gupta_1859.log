 Balance is not possible with given configuration   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Since X_C1 is already equal to 1000 Î©, the bridge can be balanced simply by placing a   
 
 
 resistance of 5000 Î© across the capacitor arm 1   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Since R3 is already of 1000 Î©, the bridge can be balanced simply by adding a   
 
 
 capacitor of reactance X_C3 of 200 Î© in series with the resistor R3 in arm 3.
