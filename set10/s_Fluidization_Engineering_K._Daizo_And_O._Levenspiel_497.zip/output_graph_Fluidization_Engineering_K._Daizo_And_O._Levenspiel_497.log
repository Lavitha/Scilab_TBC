Comparing the points with the plot of Kbc,Kbe vs db in Fig.(12), we can conlcude the following: 

Kbc for fine particles and helium: line 2 in Fig.(12) 

Kbc for coarser particles and ozone: line 3 in Fig.(12) 

Kbe for fine particles and helium: line 4 in Fig.(12) 

Kbe for coarser particles and ozone: line 5 in Fig.(12)
