 atmospheric pressure(Patm)in kpa   
 
 Patm=rho*g*h2/10^3   
 Patm  =
 
    101.39616  
 
 pressure due to mercury column at AB(Pab)in kpa   
 
 Pab=rho*g*h1/10^3   
 Pab  =
 
    53.3664  
 
 pressure exerted by gas(Pgas)in kpa   
 
 Pgas=Patm+Pab   
 Pgas  =

 balancing pressure at plane BC in figure we get   
 
 Psteam+Pwater=Patm+Pmercury   
 
 now 1.atmospheric pressure(Patm)in pa   
 
 Patm=RHOm*g*h1   
 Patm  =
 
    101396.16  
 
 2.pressure due to water(Pwater)in pa   
 
 Pwater=RHOw*g*h2   
 Pwater  =
 
    196.2  
 
 3.pressure due to mercury(Pmercury)in pa   
 
 Pmercury=RHOm*g*h3   
 Pmercury  =
 
    13341.6  
 
 using balancing equation   
 
 Psteam=Patm+Pmercury-Pwater   
 
 so pressure of steam(Psteam)in kpa   
 
 Psteam=(Patm+Pmercury-Pwater)/1000   
 Psteam  =
 
    114.54156

 here let us assume that the pressure is always equal to atmospheric presure as ballon is flexible,inelastic and unstressed and no work is don 
      e for stretching ballon during its filling figure shows the boundary of system before and after filling ballon by firm line and dotted l 
      ine respectively.                                                                                                                        
 
 displacement work, W=(p.dv)cylinder+(p.dv)ballon   
 
 (p.dv)cylinder=0,as cylinder is rigid   
 
 so work done by system upon atmosphere(W)in KJ, W=(p*deltav)/1000   
 W  =
 
    40.52  
 
 and work done by atmosphere=-40.52 KJ
