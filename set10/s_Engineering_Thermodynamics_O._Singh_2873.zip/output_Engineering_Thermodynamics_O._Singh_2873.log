 also from total work output,Q1_a+Q1_b-Q2-Q3=W

 let us assume flow to be from 1 to 2   
 
 so entropy change(deltaS1_2)=s1-s2=Cp*log(T1/T2)-R*log(p1/p2)in KJ/kg K   
 deltaS1_2  =
 
  - 0.0125414  
 
 deltaS1_2=s1-s2=0.01254 KJ/kg K   
 
 it means s2 > s1 hence the assumption that flow is from 1 to 2 is correct as from second law of thermodynamics the entropy increases in a pro 
      cess i.e s2 is greater than or equal to s1                                                                                               
 
 hence flow occurs from 1 to 2 i.e from 0.5 MPa,400K to 0.3 Mpa & 350 K

 Let us carry out analysis for 1 kg of steam generated in boiler.   
 
 Enthalpy at inlet to HPT,h2=2960.7 KJ/kg,s2=6.3615 KJ/kg K   
 
 state at 3  i.e. exit from HPT can be identified by s2=s3=6.3615 KJ/kg K

 If one kg of steam is generated in bolier then at exit of HPT,0.5 kg goes into process heater and 0.5 kg goes into separator   
 
 mass of moisture retained in separator(m)=(1-x3)*0.5 kg

 Total mass of water entering hot well at 8(i.e. from process heater and drain from separator)=(0.5+0.685)=0.5685 kg   
 
 Let us assume the temperature of water leaving hotwell be T oc.Applying heat balance for mixing;   
 
 (0.5685*4.18*90)+(0.4315*4.18*40)=(1*4.18*T)

 T  =

 so temperature of water leaving hotwell=68.425 degree celcius   
 
 Applying heat balanced on trap   
 
 0.5*h7+0.0685*hf at 2 bar=(0.5685*4.18*90)

 i> theoretically state of air at exit can be determined by the given stage pressure ratio of 1.35.Let pressure at inlet to first stage P1 and 
       subsequent intermediate pressure be P2,P3,P4,P5,P6,P7,P8 and exit pressure being P9.                                                    
 
 therefore,P2/P1=P3/P2=P4/P3=P5/P4=P6/P5=P7/P6=P8/P7=P9/P8=r=1.35   
 
 or P9/P1=k=(1.35)^8   
 k  =
 
    11.032404  
 
 or theoretically,the temperature at exit of compressor can be predicted considering isentropic compression of air(y=1.4)   
 
 T9/T1=(P9/P1)^((y-1)/y)   
 
 so T9=T1*(P9/P1)^((y-1)/y) in K   
 T9  =
 
    621.47413  
 
 considering overall efficiency of compression 82% the actual temperature at compressor exit can be obtained   
 
 (T9-T1)/(T9_actual-T1)=0.82   
 
 so T9_actual=T1+((T9-T1)/0.82) in K   
 T9_actual  =
 
    689.18796  
 
 let the actual index of compression be n, then   
 
 (T9_actual/T1)=(P9/P1)^((n-1)/n)   
 
 so n=log(P9/P1)/(log(P9/P1)-log(T9-actual/T1))   
 n  =
 
    1.4898572  
 
 so state of air at exit of compressor,pressure=11.03 bar and temperature=689.18 K   
 
 ii> let polytropic efficiency be n_polytropic for compressor then,

 n_polytropic  =

 iii> stage efficiency can be estimated for any stage.say first stage.

 actual temperature at exit of first stage can be estimated using polytropic index 1.49.

    381.28564

 T4_actual  =
 
    420.82692  
 
 ideal temperature at exit of third stage,   
 
 T4/T3_actual=(P4/P3)^((n-1)/n)

 dh=dq+v*dp   
 
 dq=0 in adiabatic process   
 
 dh=v*dp   
 
 Wc=v*dp   
 
 here for polytropic compression    
 
 P*V^1.49=constant i.e n=1.49   
 
 Wc=(n/(n-1))*m*R*T1*[((P9/P1)^((n-1)/n))-1] in KJ/s   
 Wc  =
 
    16419.874  
 
 due to overall efficiency being 90% the actual compressor work(Wc_actual)=Wc*0.9 in KJ/s   
 Wc_actual  =
 
    14777.887  
 
 so power required to drive compressor =14777.89 KJ/s

 so air standard thermal efficiency=65.29%   
 
 Actual thermal efficiency may be different from theoretical efficiency due to following reasons   
 
 a> Air standard cycle analysis considers air as the working fluid while in actual cycle it is not air throughtout the cycle.Actual working fl 
      uid which are combustion products do not behave as perfect gas.                                                                          
 
 b> Heat addition does not occur isochorically in actual process.Also combustion is accompanied by inefficiency such as incomplete combustion, 
      dissociation of combustion products,etc.                                                                                                 
 
 c> Specific heat variation occurs in actual processes where as in air standard cycle analysis specific heat variation neglected.Also during a 
      diabatic process theoretically no heat loss occur while actually these processes are accompanied by heat losses.

 This rc is more than outer radius of cable so the increase in thickness of insulation upon rc=110.66 mmwould increase rate of heat transfer.D 
      oubling insulation thickness means new outer radius would be r1=1.5+5=6.5 mm.Hence doubling(increase) of insulation thickness would incr 
      ease heat transfer and thus temperature at interface would decrease if other parameters reamins constant.                                
 
 NOTE=>In this question value of R_total is calculated wrong in book,hence it is correctly solve above,so the values of R_total and T3 may var
