The Reflux ratio of 3 will cause the ethanol loss of 0.5 kg/day
 
Larger reflux ratios would reduce this, but the cost of additional steam will probaby make them not worthwile.
 
Smaller values of R, with corresponding reduced steam cost and larger ethanol loss, should be considered, but care must be taken to ensure vapour velocities above the weeping velocities.
