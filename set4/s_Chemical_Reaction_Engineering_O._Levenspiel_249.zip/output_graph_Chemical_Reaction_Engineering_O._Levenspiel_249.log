 From the graph,we can see that we should use plug flow with recycle   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 Part a 

  The vol of reactor is 1.080000 
m3 
 The recycle flow rate is 0.060714 
m3/min 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 Part b 

 For 1 tank volume is 9.000000 
m3 
 For 2 tank the volume is 2.192000 
m3 

 Part c 
 
 We should use mixed flow followed by plug flow   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 For MFR volume(m3) is 0.120000 

 For PFR volume(m3) is 0.580000 

 Total volume is 0.700000
