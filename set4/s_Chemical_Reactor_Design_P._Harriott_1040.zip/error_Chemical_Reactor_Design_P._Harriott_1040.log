 OUTPUT Ex7.7.a 

========================================================== 

The value of apparent kLa: 5.74 (sec-1) 

 The value of predicted kLa: 0.28 (sec-1) 

The absorption of oxygen is greatly enhanced by chemical reactions in the liquid film
The kinetics can be approximated by a first-order expression,the reaction would fall in the pseudo-first-order regime,
where the rate varies with the square root of the oxygen diffusivity and the rate constant. 
 
 



 OUTPUT Ex7.7.b 

========================================================== 

The value of Phi (enhancement factor) 7.0047E+04  

The value of ratio Phi_a_by_Phi:3.5E+03 

From the ratio value Phi_a is greater than Phi hence there is no significant gradient for cyclohexane
