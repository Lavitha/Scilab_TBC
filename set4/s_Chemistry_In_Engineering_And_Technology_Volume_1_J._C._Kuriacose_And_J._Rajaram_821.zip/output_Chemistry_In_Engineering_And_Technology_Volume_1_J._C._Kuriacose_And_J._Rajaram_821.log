It is seen that the pressure developed is enormous.
This takes place in a confined space,an explosion occurs.
The final pressure P2 can also be calculated from the ideal gas equation PV=nRT which gives the same result.

The combustion of acetelyne proceeds according to the equation C2H2+2.5 O2 = 2CO2+H2O,
Heat of combustion of acetylene=dH298=-310KCal. 

The scheme of calculation can be represented as Reactants at 298 = Products at T2K.
The gases present in the flame zone after combustion are CO2,H2O and unreacted N2 of the air. 

Since 2.5mol of O2 have been utilized for combustion,4*2.5mol i.e 10mol of N2 are present in the flame zone.
The heat generated at 298K,dH298 is utilized in raising the products at 298K to a temeprature of T2K. 

The Heat capacity equations given in the question can be solved and after solving we will get a quadratic equation that is T2^2+4511*T2-2.273*10^7=0 
Maximum temperature reached by an oxy-acetylene flame at constant pressure=T2=3015.0000K.

The value of a should be calculated first using Kb=(c*a^2)/(1-a)
This gives rise to a quadratic equation which can be solved to obtain the value of a. 

Usually it is permissible to use approximation methods if K<10^-5
One can neglect a in comparison to 1 and solve for a.
A better way is to use the method of succesive approximations.
This will be illustrated using the above equation 

First find the approximate value of a by neglecting the value of a in comparison with 1.
Let the approximate value be a1 
 
 

We repeat this procedure till 2 consecutive values of a do not differ significantly. 
 
 

Since the values of a2 and a3 are the same the correct value of a=1.332*10^-2
The approximate value is greater than the correct value by about 1percent.

Let us first calculate the maximum concentration of SO4 that can remain in equilibrium with PbSO4 if the concentration of Pb is 0.01M 

Concentration of SO4 in PbSO4 solution=Ksp=2.2*10^-6M
The concentration of SO4 should be greater than 2.2*10^-4M in order to precipitate Pb from a 0.01M solution as PbSO4 
 

Concentration of Pb in PbSO4 solution=Pb2=2.2*10^-5mol per litre 

Hence out of 0.01moles of Pb in a litre only 2.2*10^-5mol per litre remain in solution.the precipitation is almost 99.78percent complete. 

Therefore it can be said that Pb is quantitatively precipitated in these conditions.

The S2 should be greater than 1.4*10^-14 so that MnS will precipitate.
Let the S2 desired be 1.1*10^-11
In order to get this concentration of S2 the required H is 10^-6M

NH3 = Original concentration since amount dissociated is very low

The iconic product for Mg(OH)2 is (Mg2+)(OH-)^2 or (10^-2)(1.8*10^-5)^2 i.e 3.24*10^-12

Solubility of CaF2 solution=S=0.000218=2.18*10^-4mol per litre 

The solubility product relationship should be true,irrespective of the source Ca2+
Compared to the concentration of Ca2+ ions obtained from Ca(NO3)2,that of Ca2+ ions from CaF2 is negligible 
 

But the F- ions are obtained only from CaF2 and so (F-)=2*S1
Ksp = 3.2*10^-11=(S1+0.01)*(2*S1)^2=(0.01)*(2*S1)^2 since S1 is negligible compared to 0.01 

Solubility in 0.01M Ca(NO3)2 solution=S1=0.000028=2.83*10^-5

The total pressure in the system is equal to that due to (1-x)moles of undecomposed N2O5,
x moles of N2O4 and x/2moles of O2 i.e due to 1+(x/2)moles. 

The increase in pressure is thus due to x/2moles
So the amount of N2O5 that has decomposed at any instant i.e x is proportional to twice the observed increase in pressure 

These can be fitted into the kinetic equation for a first order reaction

Since thalf is directly proportional to concentration(doubling the concentration increases thalf by a factor 2),
the reaction is Zero order.
The half time corresponding to a concentration of 0.01M will be 24.5mins

From the graph slope=(-0.92/0.30)=(-E/(2.303*R))
Graphical evaluation of A requires the determination of the intercept on the y axis corresponding to 1/T=0
One can also calculate A from k=A*exp(-E/(R*T)) 
 

Energy of activation=E=0.014033=14.04Kcal per mol 
 
 

we can find the value of A using log10(k)=log10(A)-(E/(2.303*R*T))
Upon solving we get A=4.015*10^9litre per mol per second

The entropy of activation=dS=9.193021=9.19eu 

Since A is independent of concentration units dS does not sepend on the concentration units used
and hence the standard state.
However if the time were expressed in different units A will assume a different value
and consequently the value of dS will be different
If time were expressed in minutes A=2.75*10^15*60 per min
dS=9.19+4.57*log10(60)=17.32eu
for bimolecular reaction e^2=7.4*10^10 
so dS will result in dS=-10.1eu or mol per litre. 

If the concentration were expressed in mol per millilitre A would be 7.4*10^13 
so dS will result in dS=-10.1+13.6=3.5eu or mol per millilitre
If the concentration were expressed in molecules per millilitre the value of A will be multiplied by 6.023*10^23 
so dS would result in as dS=-10.1-94.9=-105eu or -105molecules per millilitre
