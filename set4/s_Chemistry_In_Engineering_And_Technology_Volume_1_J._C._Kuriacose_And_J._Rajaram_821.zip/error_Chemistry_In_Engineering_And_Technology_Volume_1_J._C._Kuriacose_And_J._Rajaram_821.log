K value of the reaction=K=4.000000 

In finding no. of moles we end up with quadratic equation 3*x^2-24*x+20=0.
upon solving the equation we get x=7.05 and 0.945. 

The first solution is not admissible since the maximum yield of the ester cannot exceed one mol of acetic acid.
Hence x=0.945 i.e yield of the ester is 94.5percent. 

This problem illustrates the influence of an increased concentration of the reactant
Since using one mole of each reactant the yield of ester is only 66.66percent 
acid=1-x;
