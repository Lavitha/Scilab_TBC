(a)
The intersection point of DB temperature 80Â°F and WB temperature 66.5Â°F 
lines on the relative humidity curve for 50%.
 RH = 50%  
 

(b)
From the point of intersection of the dry and wet bulb curves, move left 
horizontally to the dew point temperature curve where it meets at 60Â°F
Dew Point = 60Â°F 
 

(c)
From the point of intersection of the dry and wet bulb curves,
horizontally to the right to the moisture content plot where it meets at 76.
Moisture Content : 76 grains of water per pound of dry air.
