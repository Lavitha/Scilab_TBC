 The rates of conduction and radiation heat transfer between the plates through

 Net rate of heat transfer is

 The heat transfer rate in reality will be higher because of the natural convec

 when the air space b/w the plates is evacuted there is no conduction or convec 
      tion,and the only heat transfer between the plates will be by radiation.  
 
 
 Therefore   
 
 
 
 Net rate of heat transfer is
