 For water at a pressure of 300 kPa,the state at which v1 is 0.5 m^3/kg is seen to be in the liquid-vapor two-phase region,at whi 
      ch T=133.6 C and the quality x is

 By comparing with the values given in the table,this state is seen to be in the superheated vapor region.temperature will be cal

 From steam table, at T=300 C,ug=2563.0 kJ/kg.So,u1>ug ,it means the state is in the superheated vapor region.So, by interplotati 
      on,we find P=1648 kPa and v=0.1542 m^3/kg

 Also, under the given conditions   
 
 vf  =

 vg  =
 
    0.099627  
 
 v2  =
 
    0.0647374  
 

 hence,specific volume for water is v2 = 0.06474 m^3/kg. 
 

 Therefore ,this state is in the two phase region with quality x2=0.6456 .

 v1  =
 
    0.14922  
 
 
 Since the volume does not change during the process,the specific volume remains constant.therefore,    
 
 v2  =
 
    0.14922  
 
 
 Since vg at 40C is less than v2,it is evident that in the final state the Ammonia is superheated vapor.By interplotation,we find 
       that                                                                                                                       
 
 P2  =

 hence,the final pressure is 945 kPa

      0.2003 m^3/kg, u2=2869.1kJ/kg and x=-ve.Hence,actualt T2 must be between these two assumed values in order that x=0.By inte
