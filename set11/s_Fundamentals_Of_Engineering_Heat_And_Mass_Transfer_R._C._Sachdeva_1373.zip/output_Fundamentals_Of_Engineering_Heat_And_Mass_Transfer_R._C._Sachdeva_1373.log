 As the critical radius of insulation is much greater than that provided in the problem, the current carrying capacity of the conductor can be raised considerably in increasing the radius of plastic covering upto 6.2 cm.
 This may however lead to the problem of having too high a temperature at the cable centre if the temperature inside the plastic coating has to be kept within the given limits
