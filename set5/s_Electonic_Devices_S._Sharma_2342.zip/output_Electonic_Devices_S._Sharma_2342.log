 Since the value of I_B (5.469µA) is less than the value of I_Bmin (19.58 µA) 
 
 So the transistor is not in the saturation region. But it is conducting hence  
      it can not be in cutoff.                                                  
 
 Therefore the transistor is in the active region

 Hence the transistor is in saturation .   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The value of R_E in kΩ is :

 So R_E should be greater than this value in order to bring the transistor just
