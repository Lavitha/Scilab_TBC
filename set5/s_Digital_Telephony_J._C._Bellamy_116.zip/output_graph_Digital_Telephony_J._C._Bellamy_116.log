 The attenuation of single-mode fibre operating at 1300nm is approximately 0.35 
      dB/km. Thus,

 By seeing the figure, it can be seen that the minimum delay between a terminal 
       transmitting D bit and receiving it back in the following E bit is seven 
       bit times                                                                
 
 
 
 At a 192 kbps data rate the duration of bit is 5.2 usec. Thus, the total round 
       trip propagation time is

 c  =

 Because round trip propagation involves both direction of transmission   
 
 
 Dmax  =
 
    1820.  
 
 
 
 Result   
 
 
 
 Maximum length of wire(Lmax) = 3640 m = 3.64 km   
 
 
 
 Maximum distance(Dmax)= 1820 m = 1.82 km

 From fig, it can be that the output circuit utilization for B=0.1 and N=24 is  
      0.8.
