 Therefore,  kVA = sqrt(3)*V_L*I_L*10^-3

 Therefore,  I_L(in A) =

 For calculation of Z_s on full load, it is necessary to plot O.C.C. and S.C.C. 
       to the scale                                                             
 
 
 Note :  If for same value of I_f, both I_ssc and V_oc can be obtained from the 
       table itself, graph need not be plotted. In some problems, the values of 
       V_oc and I_ssc for same I_f are directly given, in that case too, the gr 
      aph need not be plotted.                                                  
 
 
 In this problem, I_ssc = 25 A for I_f = 1 A   
 
 
 But we want to calculate Z_s for I_ssc = its full load value which is 66.67 A. 
       So graph is required to be plotted.                                      
 
 
 For plotting O.C.C. the lines values of open circuit voltage are converted to  
      phase by dividing each value by sqrt(3)                                   
 
 
 From S.C.C.   
 
 
 For    I_scc = 66.67 A,  I_f = 2.4 A   
 
 
 From O.C.C.   
 
 
 For    I_f = 2.4 A,  (V_oc)_ph = 240 V   
 
 
 From the graph, Z_s for full load is,   
 
 
 Z_s = (V_oc)_ph / (I_scc)_ph |for same excitation   
 
 zs  =
 
    3.6  
 
 
 
 Therefore,  Z_s(in ohm/phase) =   
 
    3.6  
 
 
 R_a = 0.15 ohm/phase   
 
 xs  =
 
    3.6  
 
 
 
 Therefore,  X_s(in ohm/phase) = sqrt(Z_s^2 - R_a^2) =   
 
    3.597  
 
 
 V_ph F.L = 500 V   
 
 
 cos(phi) = 0.8   
 
 
 Therefore,  sin(phi) = 0.6 lagging p.f.   
 
 
 So E_ph for full load, 0.8 lagging p.f. condition can be calculated as,   
 
 
 (E_ph)^2 = (V_ph*cos(phi)+I_a*R_a)^2 + (V_ph*sin(phi)+I_a*X_s)^2

 Therefore,  E_ph(in V) =

 regu  =
 
    35.572  
 
 
 
 Therefore, %Regulation(in percentage) = (E_ph-V_ph / V_ph)*100 =

 Therefore,  I_L(in A) = I_aph(full load) =   
 
    52.486  
 
 
 Now I_f = 40 A for I_ssc = 52.486 A. To find Z_s, plot the O.C.C and obtain V_ 
      oc for I_f = 40 A                                                         
 
 
 From the graph, V_oc(line) = 6600 V for I_f = 40 A
