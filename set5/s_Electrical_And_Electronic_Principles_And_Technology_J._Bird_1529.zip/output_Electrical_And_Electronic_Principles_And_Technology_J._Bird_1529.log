If the current flows downwards, the direction of its 
 magnetic field due to the current alone will be clockwise when viewed from above.
 
The lines of flux will reinforce (i.e. strengthen) the main magnetic field at 
the back of the conductor and will be in opposition in the front (i.e. weaken the field).
 
 
 Hence the force on the conductor will be from back to front (i.e. toward the v 
      iewer).

For a single-turn coil, force on each coil side

When there are 300 turns on the coil there are effectively 300 parallel conductors each carrying a current of 50 mA.
 
Thus the total force produced by the current is 300 times that for a single-turn coil. Hence force on coil side,
