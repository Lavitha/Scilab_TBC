    [ TEXT BOOK SOLUTION IS PRINTED WRONGLY ( I verified by manual calculation )]
 

      WRONGLY PRINTED ANSWERS ARE :- (a) delta = 2.41 instead of 3.87 degree 
  

                                     (b) E = 6379 instead of 6675.30 V 
  

                                     (c) Ratio = 10.84 instead of 6.93 
  

 From Calculation of the Power angle (delta), rest all the Calculated values in the TEXT BOOK is WRONG because of the Power angle (delta) value is WRONGLY calculated and the same used for the further Calculation part

 IN THE ABOVE PROBLEM ALL THE VALUES PRINTED IN THE TEXT BOOK ARE NOT ACCURATE, SO VALUE OF THE TORQUE AND LINE CURRENTS ARE DIFFERING, WHEN WE COMPARED TO THE TEXT BOOK ANSWERS FOR THE SAME. 

 

 IN EVERY CALCULATED PARAMETER IN THE TEXT BOOK SLIGHT VARIATION IS THERE AS WE COMPARED TO MANUAL CALCULATION ITS FROM POSITIVE SEQUENCE VOLTAGE (Va1)
