 th1[7]=4.7 degF and th2[7]=-0.1 degF 
 Since th2[7] is not equal to th3[7], hence other values of t2 and t3 are to be assumed

 th1[8]=-0.1 degF and th2[8]=2.3 degF 
 Since th2[8] is not equal to th3[8], hence other values of t2 and t3 are to be assumed

 Assuming t2=599.3  degF and t2=399.6 degF 
 th1[9]=1.0 degF and th2[9]=0.1 degF
