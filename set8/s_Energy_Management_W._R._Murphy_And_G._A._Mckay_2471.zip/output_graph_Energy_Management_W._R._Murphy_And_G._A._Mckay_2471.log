The pay-back time of project F is 1.75 
 
The pay-back time of project E is 3.5 

 
 
As the pay-back time is less for project F,
Project F would always be choosen in practice
since prediction of savings in the early years are more reliable than long-term predictions.

 The company investigate four alternative methods of heat abstraction using the flue gas.

  System-1   The efficiency of the furnace without any air preheater is 79.2 per cent.
  System-2   The efficiency of the furnace, with the air preheater only in the system operating as shown in figure 7.3, is increased to 86.6 per cent.
  System-3   By the incorporation of the heat exchanger,the furnace efficiency is increased to 93.3 per cent using the arrangement shown in figure 7.4.
  System-4   Using no preheating,finally achievied an overall thermal  efficiency of 93.7 per cent.
  	     The new air preheater scheme is shown in figure 7.5.

 The pay-back period in all instances is less than 3.5 years.
