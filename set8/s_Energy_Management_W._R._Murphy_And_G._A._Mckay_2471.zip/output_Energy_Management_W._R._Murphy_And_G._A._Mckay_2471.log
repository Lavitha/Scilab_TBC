Coal Required is 0.75 kg/s
 
If the plant operates on a 140-h week for 50 weeks per annum the coal consumption is 18.9*0^6 kg per year.
At an average price of, for example, 35 Pound per tonne, the aanual cost is 660*10^3 Pound.

 
 
 
 
 
 
Coal Required is 0.642 kg/s

 
Assuming similar operating conditions for the plant the total coal consumption is 16.2*10^6 kg per year,
and the annual cost is 556*10^6 Pound.
 
 
 
The cost of 1.15*10^6 W of electricity for the same period of time is,assuming a cost of 23 Pound per 10^6 Wh,177*10^3Pound.
The coal equivalent to generate 1.15*10^6 W of power for the grid would be about 5.0*10^6 kg per year.

The C.H.P. unit saves a coal equivalent of 2.3*10^6kg per year,
over the system generating process steam and utilizing grid electricty.
The economic savings are 83*1063 Pound per year illustrating the benefits of a C.H.P. syatem in this case.

In a heat-pump system the work input to drive the compressor,W, produces a heat absorption capacity,Q2,
and to balance the energy flow, a quantity of heat, Q1, must be dissipated.
Thus the energy equation is
 -> Q1 = W + Q2
and the coeffient of performance is 
C.O.P. = Q1/W = Q1/(Q1 - Q2)
   Consequently the C.O.P. is always greater than unity.
The maximum theoretical value of the C.O.P. is that predicted by the Carnot in chapter 2,namely :
 -> (C.O.P.)max = T1/(T1 - T2)
