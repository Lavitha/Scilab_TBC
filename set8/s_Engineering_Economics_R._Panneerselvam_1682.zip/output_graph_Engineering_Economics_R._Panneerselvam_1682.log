 Given the following LP model :   
 
 
 maximize Z = 6*X1 + 8*X2   
 
 
 subject to   
 
 
 5*X1+10*X2 <= 60   
 
 
 4*X1+4*X2 <= 40   
 
 
 X1,X2 >= 0   
 
 
 The introduction of non-negative constraints X1>=0 and X2>=0 will eliminate the 2nd, 3rd and 4th quadrants of XY plane.   
 
 
 Compute the cordinates to plot equations relting to the constraints on the XY plane as shown below :    
 
 
 5*X1+10*X2 <= 60   
 
 
 When X1=0 : X2=6   
 
 
 When X2=0 : X1=12   
 
 
 
 
 
 Consider the 2nd constraint in the form :   
 
 
 4*X1+4*X2 <= 40   
 
 
 When X1=0 : X2=10   
 
 
 When X2=0 : X1=10   
 
 
 
 
 
 The closed polygon is the feasible region at each of the corner points of the closed polygon is computed as follows by substituting its coord 
      inates in the objective function :                                                                                                       
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ZA=6*0+8*0=0   ZB=6*10+8*0=60   ZC=6*8+8*2=64   ZD=6*0+8*6=48   
 
 
 Since the type of the objective function is maximization, the solution corresponding to the maximum Z value should be selected as the optimum 
       solution. The Z value is maximum for the corner point C. Hence, the corresponding solution is                                           
 
 
 X1 = 8  X2 = 2 and Z(Optimum) = 64
