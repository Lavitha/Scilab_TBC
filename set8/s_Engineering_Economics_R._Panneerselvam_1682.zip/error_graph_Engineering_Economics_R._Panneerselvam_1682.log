 Given the following LP model :   
 
 
 minimize Z = 2*X1 + 3*X2   
 
 
 subject to   
 
 
 X1+X2 >= 6   
 
 
 7*X1+X2 >= 14   
 
 
 X1,X2 >= 0   
 
 
 The introduction of non-negative constraints X1>=0 and X2>=0 will eliminate the 2nd, 3rd and 4th quadrants of XY plane.   
 
 
 Compute the cordinates to plot equations relting to the constraints on the XY plane as shown below :    
 
 
 X1+X2 = 6   
 
 
 When X1=0 : X2=6   
 
 
 When X2=0 : X1=6   
 
 
 
 
 
 Consider the 2nd constraint in the form :   
 
 
 7*X1+X2 = 14   
 
 
 When X1=0 : X2=14   
 
 
 When X2=0 : X1=2   
 
 
 
 
 
 The Optimum solution will be in any one of the corners A, B and C   
 
 
 The objective function value at each of these corner points of the feasible solution space is computed as fllows by substituting its coordina 
      tes in the objective function.
