 X = Rs. 7334.14   
 
 
 The comparative use value of old machine is Rs. 7334.14, which is less than the price(Rs. 8000) offered by the company which is supplying the 
       new machine in the event of replacing the old machine by nw machine.

 The cost of group replacement policy for seeral replacement periods are summarized in Table 8.6. This table can be seen from the book.   
 
 
 From table it is  that the avg cost/week is minimum for the 4th week. Hence, the group replacement period is 4 weeks.   
 
 
 Individual replacement cost/week = Rs. 207   
 
 
 Minimum group replacement ost/week = Rs. 196.50   
 
 
 Since the min group replacement cost/week is less than the individual replacement cost/week, the group replacement policy is the best, and he 
      nce all the transistors should be replaced in 4 weeks.

 Minimum group replacement ost/month = Rs. 2426.67   
 
 
 Since the min group replacement cost/month is less than the individual replacement cost/month, the group replacement policy is the best, and

 The benefit cost ratio of alternative 2 is more than that of alternative A1. Hence, alternative A2 is to be selected. The comparisoon is made 
       on a 35 years period which is the minimum common multiple of the lives of alternative 1 and 2

 Few steps are as follows :    
 
 
 Step 1 : The estimated future requirementt per year in terms of todays rupees from his age 61 through 70 is Rs. 24000.   
 
 
 Step 2 : The formula which is given below is used to get future equivalent of Rs. 24000 with the inflation of 9% per year.

 RECOMMENDATION : The person has to invest an amount of Rs. 9894.5368 at the end of every year starting from his age 41 through 60 which will  
      enable him to make a withdrawl at the end of every year starting from his age 61 through 70.

 The method of finding the economic life of the machine witha discounting factor of 20% at zero inflation rate is summarized in table below. F 
      rom the table it is  that total annual cost is minimum if the machine is used for 14 years. Hence the economic life of the machine is 14 
       years.
